						The project explores augmenting performance in the cyber-physical space and 
                                is divided into two key parts: privacy for the audience and augmenting 
                                performance. Rhino.Inside is used to incorporate voxels generated by Grasshopper 
                                from the intersection of the cone of vision of the audience, which is then blurred 
                                in Unity, using Kawase blur and URP, a Unity plugin. Then, to augment the 
                                performance, an existing machine learning model, MediaPipe Pose, is modified to 
                                generate a skeleton of the performer by detecting the performer and forming 33 
                                three-dimensional landmarks of the joints of the human body in real-time in Unity. 
                                Then, agent-based modelling (ABM), is used along with Perlin noise and an attractor 
                                to generate the augmented performance. The output is tested in HoloLens from the 
                                audience's perspective in different scenarios.
