						This Unity project manages CPU multithreaded autonomous agents vis Unity's Job System. 
                        The agent system incorporates a variety of forces, some of which are agent-centric 
                        and others environnment-centric. To optimize the overall performance, a simple spatial 
                        binning system has been developed and the agent entities are drawn directly in graphics, 
                        through GPU instancing. The agent environment is expressed as a behind the scenes 3D voxel 
                        grid of customizable resolution. The voxel grid enables the agents' stigmergic behaviours 
                        as well as the meshing of the agents' paths through a Marching Cubes algorithm. The meshed 
                        paths are also drawn directly in the GPU but there is the option to export selected mesh "frames" 
                        in .obj file format.
