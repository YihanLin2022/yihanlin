						Rapid development in manufacturing technologies have given rise to a new architectural form: media architecture, 
						which demonstrates significant potential in shaping urban spatial experiences. In peopleâ€™s interaction with media 
						content, visual attention plays a vital role. Existing studies have explored visual attention in diverse urban 
						contexts, but few of them were researched to understand its dynamics within media architecture. Therefore, this
						 paper aims to fill the gap by modelling visual attention and analysing the impacts of digital content and 
						 spatial layout by both qualitative and quantitative methods. This study conducted 17 field experiments to 
						 collect video data by head-mounted cameras and then constructed the participants' visual attention model. 
						 Various attributes of digital elements were quantitatively analysed. The results have indicated that the 
						 relative animation speed and levels of interactivity impact most visual attention in media architecture. 
						 The findings revealed the complex dynamics of how viewers engaged with digital content in media architecture, 
						 providing evidence and insights for creating urban media environments.
